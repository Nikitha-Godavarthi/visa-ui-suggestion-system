# Visa Design System – Natural Language → Component Suggestion Tool

This is a web application that lets developers describe UI components in natural language and receive:

- Suggested components from the **Visa Product Design System**.
- Ready-to-use React code snippets using Visa Nova components.

---

## Features Implemented

- Designed and built a real-time UI suggestion tool that returns tailored component code snippets based on natural language input.
- Hardcoded the Component suggestion logic and generated code logic into the backend.
- Integrated “Copy to Clipboard” functionality for both suggested components and full code output, enhancing user efficiency.
- Persisted user interactions by storing and displaying recent search queries using browser localStorage.

---

## Approach & Technical Choices

- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript + Visa Nova Design System.
- **Backend**: Express.js with a lightweight REST API.
- **Component Suggestion Logic**: Rule-based keyword matcher (no AI or ML).
- **Design**: Fully responsive layout, consistent Nova styling, fixed header, and onboarding message.

---

## ⚙️ Assumptions & Shortcuts

- **No real AI model** – all logic is manually hardcoded via keyword matching.
- **Recent queries are stored in memory only**, not persisted.
- **Only a subset** of commonly-used Nova components are included for suggestions.

---

## Improvements With More Time

- Integrate a lightweight NLP/LLM backend for smarter intent understanding.
- Add real-time live preview of suggested components.
- Enable saving snippets to a database.
- Expand component database and support theme switching.
- Conduct full WCAG 2.1 + VGAR accessibility audit.

---

## AI Usage

- ChatGPT was used to brainstorm features, refine UI copy, and assist in drafting rule-based logic. All application logic and integration were developed and customized manually.
- Leveraged AI suggestions for component organization, React hook patterns, and state management approaches.
